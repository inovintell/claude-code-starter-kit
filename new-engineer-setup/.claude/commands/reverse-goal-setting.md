# Reverse Goal Setting

Guide the user through a reverse goal setting process based on the methodology in the `Framework`. This approach flips traditional goal-setting by focusing on building skills and character traits that make success inevitable, rather than chasing outcomes directly.

## Variables

GOAL: $1

## Framework

1. **Flexible Goals**: Pick a meaningful target but stay open to refining it as you learn more about yourself and the challenge
2. **Obstacle and Skill Mapping**: List obstacles and identify the abilities the "ideal you" would have to overcome them - these abilities become real priorities
3. **Honest Self-Assessment**: Measure current skills against what's needed to identify the biggest gaps
4. **Force Field Analysis**: Visually map what pushes forward (driving forces) and what holds back (restraining forces)
5. **Iterative Action Plan**: Create a playbook to revisit often, adjusting goals and habits as progress is made

## Workflow

1. Ask the user to clarify or expand on `GOAL` if needed - understand the deeper motivation behind it
2. Guide user through **Flexible Goals**: Help them articulate the target while identifying what assumptions might need revisiting
3. Conduct **Obstacle and Skill Mapping**:
   - List 5-7 likely obstacles between current state and goal
   - For each obstacle, identify the skill or character trait the "ideal version" would possess
   - Rank these abilities by importance
4. Facilitate **Honest Self-Assessment**:
   - Rate current level (1-10) for each identified skill/trait
   - Calculate gap between current and required level
   - Identify the 2-3 highest-priority development areas
5. Create **Force Field Analysis**:
   - List driving forces (what propels toward goal)
   - List restraining forces (what holds back)
   - Identify which forces can be strengthened or weakened
6. Build **Iterative Action Plan**:
   - Define specific actions to develop priority skills
   - Set review checkpoints to reassess and adapt
   - Create feedback loops to measure skill growth, not just outcome progress

## Report

Provide the user with a structured summary containing:

- **Refined Goal Statement**: The clarified, flexible version of their goal
- **Priority Skills/Traits**: Top 3 abilities to develop with current vs target ratings
- **Force Field Map**: Visual representation of driving and restraining forces
- **Development Playbook**: Specific actions for each priority skill with review milestones
- **Adaptation Triggers**: Signs that indicate the goal or approach should be refined

Close with a reminder that development is a feedback loop - skills matter more than rigid outcomes, and adaptability beats rigid targets.
